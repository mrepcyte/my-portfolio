                    My name is Monika. Among great many things that I am curious about, things that
                    I fill my days with - books, writing, photography, languages - there's also the
                    vast, exciting world of frontend development. I'm grasping at every learning
                    opportunity, because ultimately I see my purpose in creating and building. I
                    want to build things big and small, things beautiful and functional and inviting
                    and whimsical. Be it an idea, a component, a project, Iâ€™m interested in the
                    whole spectrum. Below are some examples of my work so far.
